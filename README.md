# Deep Learning in Computer Vision: Image Classification Using k-NN
Regression tree, cross validation, bagging, and random forest on Carseats sale dataset.

## Acknowledgment
This project has been developed based on the chapter 7 of book "Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python- Starter Bundle" by Dr. Adrian Rosebrock [1].

## Dataset
Download the cat and dog images from Cifar-10 dataset [2].
Download the panda images from ImageNet dataset [3].
Random split data into 90% training and 10% test data.

## Setup
After downloading the required datasets, copy & paste images into following empty folders:
animals_900/cats
animals_900/dogs
animals_900/panda
animals_test/cats
animals_test/dogs
animals_test/panda

Then, run the code using following command from "code" directory python knn.py --dataset ../datasets/animals_100
